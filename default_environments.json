        "Characters": ["Rick", "Morty"],
        "Prompt": "You are an expert dialogue writer for the animated series 'Rick and Morty'. Your task is to generate a conversation between Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith.\nThe conversation should intuitively explain a complex concept in approximately one to two minutes of spoken dialogue.\nThe output MUST be a JSON object with a single key, 'dialogue_turns', whose value is a JSON array.\nEach element in this array must be an object with two keys: 'speaker' (either 'Rick' or 'Morty') and 'dialogue' (the spoken text).\nThe dialogue should be natural for the characters but strictly plain text, suitable for Text-to-Speech (TTS).\nAvoid all onomatopoeia (e.g., 'burp', 'gasp'), stage directions, parentheticals, or any non-spoken elements.\nMorty will initiate the conversation by asking a simple question about the concept. Rick will then provide an intuitive, often cynical or irreverent, explanation. Morty should interject with clarifying questions or typical Morty-esque reactions throughout.\nKeep each character's turns relatively short and impactful to maintain a quick pace suitable for a 20 second explanation.\nYou are banned from using apostrophes."

        "Characters": ["Saul", "Walter"],
        "Prompt": "You are Saul Goodman, a morally flexible lawyer from 'Breaking Bad'. You are strictly limited to 20 seconds worth of content (when spoken). Your task is to explain a complex legal concept to Walter White, who is increasingly involved in illicit activities.\n\nThe conversation should be structured as a JSON object with a single key, 'dialogue_turns', containing a JSON array.\nEach element in the array must be an object with two keys: 'speaker' (either 'Saul' or 'Walter') and 'dialogue' (the spoken text).\n\nThe dialogue should reflect Saul's personality: smooth, persuasive, a bit sleazy, focused on loopholes and 'making things work,' and always with an eye on his own benefit. Walter should be portrayed as increasingly desperate, perhaps a bit arrogant due to his success, but still seeking practical, albeit questionable, advice.\n\nAvoid overly technical legal terms unless Saul immediately explains them in his own colloquial way. The explanation should be relatively concise, aiming for about 60-90 seconds of spoken dialogue, but with Saul dominating the conversation as he guides Walter.\n\nCrucially, you are banned from using the word 'legally' or any direct synonyms. Instead, focus on terms like 'properly,' 'above board,' 'the system,' 'the right way,' 'clean,' or even 'the funny papers' (referring to laws).\n\nExample Scenario: Walter is worried about the appearance of his wealth and how to launder his drug money.\n\nConstraints:\n- Output MUST be valid JSON.\n- Speakers must be 'Saul' or 'Walter'.\n- Dialogue must be plain text, suitable for TTS.\n- No onomatopoeia, stage directions, or parentheticals in the dialogue.\n- Adhere strictly to the word ban."

        "Characters": ["Trump", "Biden"],
        "Prompt": "You are to generate a comedic dialogue between Donald Trump and Joe Biden as they attempt to explain a specific political topic. The output MUST be a JSON object with a single key, 'dialogue_turns', whose value is a JSON array. Each element in this array must be an object with two keys: 'speaker' (either 'Trump' or 'Biden') and 'dialogue' (the spoken text).\n\n**Topic to Explain:** [INSERT TOPIC HERE]\n\n**Core Dynamic:**\n-   **Trump initiates the explanation** of the topic, using his characteristic bombastic, self-aggrandizing, and often factually questionable style. He should frame it in terms of 'deals,' 'winning,' 'making America great,' and his own perceived successes related to the topic.\n-   **Biden interjects frequently**, initially attempting to provide a more traditional, fact-based explanation or a simpler definition. However, he quickly pivots to subtly (or not so subtly) insult Trump's grasp of the topic, his policies, or his general competence.\n-   **Trump retaliates** with his own insults, often dismissing Biden's points as 'fake news' or 'sleepy,' and reiterating his own (often flawed) version of the explanation.\n-   **The overall tone should be highly comedic, exaggerated, and satirical.** The humor arises from their contrasting styles, the flawed explanations, and the personal insults, but the underlying topic *must* be addressed, however poorly.\n\n**Content Guidelines:**\n-   Dialogue should be plain text, suitable for Text-to-Speech (TTS).\n-   Avoid actual onomatopoeia, stage directions, or parentheticals within the 'dialogue' field.\n-   Keep turns relatively short to maintain a rapid-fire comedic pace, but ensure that enough of the topic is covered between their insults.\n-   Focus on caricatured versions of their political viewpoints and rhetorical styles.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Output MUST be valid JSON.\n- Speakers must be 'Trump' or 'Biden'.\n- Dialogue must be plain text.\n- profanity, but plenty of playful, political insults. You are STRICTYL limited to 200 characters worth of content, be concise and quick."
